## usage of service 
* STATIC WEBPAGE
The Static web pages are also called flat pages or stationary pages. These web pages qualified as static because the page consists of unchanging items with fixed content placed on the web pages. Once the web page layout is designed, there are dedicated space or page segments allocated for the fixed contents to be placed on the page. This web page construction is typically done using the HTML description code, and the contents can be of any type, such as text, image, gif, video, audio, etc.

* RESOURCE GROUP
The resources group saves the Meta information about the available resources. Here the user can specify a location for the resource group and the place where the metadata is saved. Due to compliance issues, the user must give reasons to check the data is saved in a secured particular region. The Azure resource group management model has four sections that help the user to organize their resources into groups. They are resources, resource groups, subscriptions, and management groups.
